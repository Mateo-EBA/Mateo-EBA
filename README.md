## Welcome to my github profile!
I am Mateo Balla, a biomedical engineer passionate about programming and artificial intelligence. Here is a brief description of my skills and experience:

### ðŸ§  Machine Learning:
I have experience in Python, developing machine learning models with PyTorch, Keras and Weights&Biases. I have hands-on experience in segmentation, object detection and classification techniques in images, including architectures such as U-Net and YOLO. During my academical studies I developed skills in 2D and 3D digital image processing, which allowed me to process the inputs and outputs of the model and extract valuable information.

### ðŸ’» Software development:
In addition to my experience in Machine Learning with Python, I am proficient in software development using C#. I have experience developing applications using WinForms, which allowed me to create interactive and easy-to-use software solutions. I'm also an expert in MATLAB, an incredibly powerful tool for rapid prototyping. Finally, by coding in Unity as a hobby I gained a solid foundation in SOLID principles and have been developing the skill to apply them ever since.

### ðŸ¤– Passion for AI:
I am passionate about learning and experimenting with the latest AI technologies. I have experience working with LLMs such as ChatGPT, learning appropriate prompt engineering techniques to help in creative processes, writing and even learning new programming languages. I am also interested in image generation techniques, such as Stable Diffusion and its extensions, which have the potential to revolutionize the way we create and manipulate digital images. Additionally, I have experience working with speech-to-text technologies like WhisperAI, enabling fast and accurate audio and video transcriptions.
